    "## Overview\n",
    "Throughout the past decade, Big 5 has been notorious for personality assessments and self-discovery. We wanted to look further into this topic, and the connection between Divorce Rates and the Big 5. Big 5 is hypothesized to have traits that are more correlated with higher/lower Divorce rates. That is what we will look further into. Although Big 5 is misinformed to be known as pseudosciences, these forms of self-acknowledgement are great for human growth and development.\n"

    "Big 5, a well known and well established form of personality assessments, has 5 major traits that look into the overall identity of the person taking the assessment. The five traits are as follows: Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. The 5 traits get scored in either: Below Average, Average, or Above Average in scale. Depending on one's personality, they may score higher or lower in different regions. Alongside Big 5 is several other terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes but is not limited to: OCEAN/CANOE and Global 5-SLOAN. The prior being a way to remember the overall format, and the latter being a more modern way of calculating and scoring the data provided. SLOAN formats the 5 original names into 10 other names: Social/Reserved, Limbic/Calm, Organized/Unstructured, Accommodating/Egocentric, and Non-Curious/Inquisitive. SLOAN is helpful in better subjecting the many personalities into 32 possible types<sup>[1](#SimilarTypesSLOAN)</sup>\n",
